// Load required pipeline libraries
// These libraries provide shared functionality and utilities for the build process
// Requires pipeline-github-lib plugin to load library from github
@Library('github.com/Mellanox/ci-demo@stable_media')  // External library for matrix build functionality

// Load Blossom GitHub library
// This library provides functionality for interacting with GitHub
// It is used to update the commit status and upload logs

// Initialize the build matrix
// The matrix class handles the parallel execution of different build configurations
// It manages the build environment, test execution, and result reporting
def matrix = new com.mellanox.cicd.Matrix()

// Execute the main build process
// This will:
// 1. Parse the build matrix configuration from .ci/jenkins/lib/build-matrix.yaml
// 2. Set up the build environment
// 3. Execute build steps in parallel based on the matrix configuration
// 4. Handle test execution and reporting
// 5. Manage artifacts and build results
matrix.main()
