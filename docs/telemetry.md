# NIXL Telemetry System

## Overview

The NIXL telemetry system provides real-time monitoring and performance tracking capabilities for NIXL applications. It collects various metrics and events during runtime and exports them via telemetry plug-in.
Plug-in could be dynamically linked or used static one which stores telemetry in shared memory buffers that can be read by telemetry reader applications.
For creating custom telemetry exporters, see [src/plugins/telemetry/README.md](../src/plugins/telemetry/README.md).

## Architecture

### Telemetry Components

1. **Telemetry Collection**: Built into the NIXL core library, collects events and metrics
2. **Shared Memory Buffer**: Static built in implemenation of telemetry exporter. Uses shared memory cyclic buffer for efficient event storage
3. **Telemetry Readers**: C++ and Python applications to read and display telemetry data from cyclic buffer
4. **Prometheus exporter**: EXPERIMENTAL prometheus compitable telemetry exporter, see [src/plugins/telemetry/prometheus/README.md](../src/plugins/telemetry/prometheus/README.md).

### Event Structure

Each telemetry event contains:
- **Timestamp**: Microsecond precision timestamp
- **Category**: Event category for filtering and aggregation
- **Event Name**: Descriptive name/identifier for the event
- **Value**: Numeric value associated with the event

### Event Categories

The telemetry system supports the following event categories:

| Category | Description | Example Events |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_MEMORY` | Memory operations | Memory registration, deregistration, allocation |
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_TRANSFER` | Data transfer operations | Bytes transmitted/received, request counts |
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_CONNECTION` | Connection management | Connect, disconnect events |
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_BACKEND` | Backend-specific operations | Backend initialization, configuration |
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_ERROR` | Error events | Error counts by type |
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_PERFORMANCE` | Performance metrics | Transaction times, latency measurements |
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_SYSTEM` | System-level events | Process start/stop, resource usage |
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_CUSTOM` | Custom/user-defined events | Application-specific metrics |

### Events Description

The following table lists all built-in telemetry events generated by NIXL:

| Event Name | Category | Statefull | Unit | Description |
|------------|----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| `agent_memory_registered` | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_MEMORY` | Yes | bytes | Total bytes of memory registered with the agent |
| `agent_memory_deregistered` | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_MEMORY` | Yes | bytes | Total bytes of memory deregistered from the agent |
| `agent_tx_bytes` | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_TRANSFER` | No | bytes | Total bytes transmitted by the agent |
| `agent_rx_bytes` | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_TRANSFER` | No | bytes | Total bytes received by the agent |
| `agent_tx_requests_num` | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_TRANSFER` | No | count | Number of transmit requests sent by the agent |
| `agent_rx_requests_num` | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_TRANSFER` | No | count | Number of receive requests processed by the agent |
| `agent_xfer_time` | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_PERFORMANCE` | Yes | microseconds | Transfer time from start to complete (per request) |
| `agent_xfer_post_time` | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_PERFORMANCE` | Yes | microseconds | Time from start to posting to backend (per request) |
| Backend-specific events | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_BACKEND` | - | varies | Dynamic events generated by backend implementations |
| Error status strings | `NIXL_TELEMETRY_ERROR` | No | count | Error occurrences by status type |

**Statefull**
- **No**: Each event is separate ocassion with no knowledge of overall system statistic. E.g agent_tx_bytes represents number of bytes transfered by this particular operation and not cummulutive number of bytes transferred since the transaction has began.
- **Yes**: System aware events, value that can increase or decrease. E.g agent_memory_registered could go either way, depending on current memory occupation.

### Telemetry Details

- Timestamp is done after the operation completion
- Current design allows silent telemetry loss
- Current design does not support selective telemetry(e.g per category). It could be either ON or OFF

## Enabling Telemetry

### Runtime Configuration

Telemetry is controlled by environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_ENABLE` | Enable telemetry collection | Disabled |
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_BUFFER_SIZE` | Number of events in buffer | `4096` |
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_RUN_INTERVAL` | Flush interval (ms) | `100` |

- NIXL_TELEMETRY_ENABLE can be set to y/yes/on/1 to be enabled, and n/no/off/0 (or not set) to be disabled,

## Cyclic Buffer

Following sections  applied specifically for configuration and usage of cyclic buffer exporter

### Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NIXL_TELEMETRY_DIR` | Directory for telemetry files | - |

- If NIXL_TELEMETRY_ENABLE is set to enabled but NIXL_TELEMETRY_DIR is not set, no telemetry file is generated and NIXL_TELEMETRY_RUN_INTERVAL is not used.

### Telemetry File Format

Telemetry data is stored in shared memory files with the agent name passed when creating the agent.

### Using Telemetry Readers

### C++ Telemetry Reader

The C++ telemetry reader (`telemetry_reader.cpp`) provides a robust way to read and display telemetry events.

#### Running the C++ Reader

```bash
# Read from a specific telemetry file
./builddir/examples/cpp/telemetry_reader /tmp/agent_name
```

### Python Telemetry Reader

The Python telemetry reader (`telemetry_reader.py`) provides similar functionality with additional features.

#### Running the Python Reader

```bash
# Read from a specific telemetry file
python3 examples/python/telemetry_reader.py --telemetry_path /tmp/agent_name
```

## Example Output

Both readers produce similar formatted output:

```
=== NIXL Telemetry Event ===
